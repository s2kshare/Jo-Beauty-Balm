                        My passion for the beauty industry started when I was 19
                        & received my first facial treatment. I thought 'wow
                        this is how I want to make people feel' and I have now
                        been a fully qualified Beauty Therapist & working in the
                        beauty industry for over 17 years. I love making people
                        look & feel amazing. I love my job & consider myself a
                        natural at what I do. My most common compliments are
                        'best facial/massage ever', and my favorite massage
                        compliment is 'incredible' & love it when clients
                        describe my hands as 'magical' I absolutely love when
                        people leave their eyebrows in my hands so I can work my
                        magic as a brow artist, confident to work with both Male
                        & female. I'm all for affordable treatments to all, so I
                        am very pleased to be able to offer my treatments at
                        home salon prices. I take the natural approach to
                        skincare using only natural & organic products that give
                        the best results and can be tailored to suit any skin
                        type, perfect for those sensitive skin ranges. I have
                        put my all into making my Beauty space as comfortable &
                        peaceful & possible & can't wait to share with you the
                        Tranquil experience that awaits you at Jo's Beauty BALM
